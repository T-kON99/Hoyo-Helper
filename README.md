# Hoyo Helper

This is a hoyo helper intended to help user check-ins automatically

## Setting Up

### Hoyo Credentials

You require the cookies containing `ltuid` and `ltoken`, which the format of the token can be seen as the following:

```python
HOYO_TOKENS = [
    {
        "ltoken": "xxx",
        "ltuid": 000,
        "games": ["gs", "hsr"],
    },
]
```

Supports multiple tokens, in case you want to do it for multiple accounts...

*games* field must be one of `(gs, hsr, hi3)`

```bash
export 'HOYO_TOKENS = "<above token in string format>"'
```

export 'DISCORD_WEBHOOK = "<your_webhook_discord_channel_here>"'
```
